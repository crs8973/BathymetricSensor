# Bathymetric Drift Sensor
Group Members: Autumn, Grant, Teryn, and Camille

This is the repository for the group working on the drifter with GPS, cellular, and bathymetric sensing. 

Step 1: Find and fork an existing repository to one team member's GitHub account (done), clone (through GitHub desktop) to your computer (done), assess current status, and divide next steps.

Device currently doesn't work well and has not been validated at all.

Goal for 10-28-24: Open premade project folder in VS Code and confirm it will compile. Make sure cellular does not turn off when running the sensor.
